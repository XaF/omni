# `cd`

Change directory to the git directory of the specified repository

If no repository or path is specified, change to the git directory of the first organization's worktree, or defaults to the default worktree.

## Parameters

### Arguments

| Argument        | Value type | Description                                         |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `repo` | string | The name of the repo to change directory to; this can be in the format of a full git URL, or `<org>/<repo>`, or just `<repo>`, in which case the repo will be searched for in all the organizations in the order in which they are defined, and then trying all the other repositories in the configured worktrees. |

## Examples

```bash
# Let's say:
#  - our worktree is /home/xaf/git
#  - we cloned omni to /home/xaf/git/github.com/XaF/omni

# We can cd using a full git URL
omni cd https://github.com/XaF/omni  # CWD: /home/xaf/git/github.com/XaF/omni

# Or using parts of the repo identifier -- this is faster if matched with an organization
omni cd XaF/omni  # CWD: /home/xaf/git/github.com/XaF/omni
omni cd omni      # CWD: /home/xaf/git/github.com/XaF/omni

# Will switch the the root of the first organization's worktree, or to the
# root of the default worktree if no organization is configured
omni cd  # CWD: /home/xaf/git

# Will act like the regular `cd` command if provided with paths
omni cd ~               # CWD: /home/xaf
omni cd relative/path   # CWD: /home/xaf/relative/path
omni cd -               # CWD: /home/xaf
omni cd /absolute/path  # CWD: /absolute/path
omni cd ..              # CWD: /absolute
```
