# `tidy`

Organize your git repositories using the configured format

This will offer to organize your git repositories, moving them from their current path to the path they should be at
if they had been cloned using `omni clone`. This is useful if you have a bunch of repositories that you have cloned
manually, and you want to start using omni, or if you changed your mind on the repo path format you wish to use.

## Parameters

### Options

|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--yes` | `null` | Do not ask for confirmation before organizing repositories |
| `--search-path` | string | Extra path to search git repositories to tidy up (repeat as many times as you need) |

## Examples

```bash
# Simply search the known worktrees, ask for confirmation before doing anything
omni tidy

# Simply search the know worktrees, just organize everything that needs organizing
omni tidy --yes

# Search git repositories in another path

```
