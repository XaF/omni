# `tidy`

Organize your git repositories using the configured format.

This will offer to organize your git repositories, moving them from their current path to the path they should be at
if they had been cloned using `omni clone`. This is useful if you have a bunch of repositories that you have cloned
manually, and you want to start using omni, or if you changed your mind on the repo path format you wish to use.

This will also download any package in your global omnipath that is not yet downloaded.

## Parameters
