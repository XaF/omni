description: Builtin command `up`
---

# `up`

Sets up a repository depending on its `up` configuration.

The steps to set up the repository are defined in the [`up` configuration parameter](/reference/configuration/parameters/up) of the [repository configuration file](/reference/configuration/files#per-repository-configuration). Those steps are followed in the order in which they are defined when running `omni up`.

Running this command will also refresh the [dynamic environment](/reference/dynamic-environment) of the repository in which it is being run, and cleanup some unused dependencies that omni installed during previous `omni up` calls.

:::info
**This needs to be run from a git repository.** If you just created a directory with a basic `up` configuration to start working on a whole new project, run `git init` **and add a remote** before calling `omni up`, as `omni up` depends on the remote identifier to store `up` configuration to be loaded dynamically.

## Parameters

### Options

| Option          | Value type | Description                                         |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--update-repository` | `null` | Whether we should update the repository before running the command; if the repository is already up to date, the rest of the process will be skipped |
| `--update-user-config` | enum: `yes`, `ask` or `no` | Whether we should handle suggestions found in the configuration of the repository if any; The `suggest_config` configuration will be copied to the global configuration of the user to be loaded on every omni call *(default: no)* |
| `--trust` | enum: `always`, `yes`, or `no` | Define how to trust the repository to run the command *(defaults to ask the user)* |

## Examples

```bash
# Simply run the up steps for that repository
omni up

# Update (git pull, or fetch tag) the repository before running the up steps
omni up --update-repository

# Skip the trust question
omni up --trust=yes

# Cache the fact that we trust that repository
omni up --trust=always

# Gets suggestions for the global configuration if any available from the repository
omni up --update-user-config
```
