# `path`

Configuration to build the omni path, where omni will look for commands to make available to the user.

Once built, the omni path works like the `PATH` environment variable but for omni commands: only the first command in the path for a given name will be considered.

## Parameters

| Parameter  | Type           | Description                                       |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `append` | list of strings | List of the paths (strings) to append to the omni path |
| `prepend` | list of strings | List of the paths (strings) to prepend to the omni path |

If you want to be able to stack paths in different configuration files, you can take advantage of [the configuration merging strategies](suggest_config#configuration-merging-strategies).

## Example

```yaml
path:
  append:
    - /absolute/path
    - relative/path
  prepend:
    - /absolute/path
    - relative/path
```

## Environment

The environment variable `OMNIPATH` can be used to add paths as a colon-separated list. Any path added through the `OMNIPATH` environment variable will be considered after `path/prepend` and before `path/append`.

```bash
export OMNIPATH=/absolute/path1:/absolute/path2
```
