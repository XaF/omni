# `python` operation

Installs python to be used by the current repository.

:::note
Omni uses [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) in the background to manage that tool. The `asdf` installation of omni is in its own directory, and won't conflict with any installation of `asdf` you might have on your system.
:::

## Parameters

The following parameters can be used:

| Parameter        | Type      | Description                                           |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `dir` | path | Relative path (or list of relative paths) to the directory in the project for which to use the python version; each specified directory will have its own virtual environment. |
| `pip` | path | Relative path (or list of relative paths) to the requirements files to be used as parameter to `pip install -r` for installing dependencies; if using the word `auto`, omni will try to install the `requirements.txt` file in each specified `dir` (or in each discovered directory with `version: auto`) if it exists |
| `url` | string | The URL to download the tool from, in case the tool is not registered in [`asdf-plugins`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins) or if you want to use a custom version. |
| `version` | string | The version of the tool to install; see [version handling](#version-handling) below for more details. |

### Version handling

The following strings can be used to specify the version:

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `1.2`     | Accepts `1.2` and any version prefixed by `1.2.*` |
| `1.2.3`   | Accepts `1.2.3` and any version prefixed by `1.2.3.*` |
| `~1.2.3`  | Accepts `1.2.3` and higher patch versions (`1.2.4`, `1.2.5`, etc. but not `1.3.0`) |
| `^1.2.3`  | Accepts `1.2.3` and higher minor and patch versions (`1.2.4`, `1.3.1`, `1.4.7`, etc. but not `2.0.0`) |
| `>1.2.3`  | Must be greater than `1.2.3` |
| `>=1.2.3` | Must be greater or equal to `1.2.3` |
| `<1.2.3`  | Must be lower than `1.2.3` |
| `<=1.2.3` | Must be lower or equal to `1.2.3` |
| `1.2.x`   | Accepts `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, etc. but will not accept `1.3.0` |
| `*`       | Matches any version (will default to `latest`) |
| `latest`  | Latest release (default) |
| `auto`    | Lookup for any version files in the project directory (`.tool-versions` or `.python-version`) and apply version parsing |

The version also supports the `||` operator to specify ranges. This operator is not compatible with the `latest` and `auto` keywords. For instance, `1.2.x || >1.3.5 <=1.4.0` will match any version between `1.2.0` included and `1.3.0` excluded, or between `1.3.5` excluded and `1.4.0` included.

The latest version satisfying the requirements will be installed.

## Examples

```yaml
up:
  # Will install the latest version of python
  - python

  # And also
  - python: latest

  # Let omni lookup for version files in the project
  - python: auto

  # Will install any version starting with 3.11, and containing
  # only dots and numbers after
  - python: 3.11

  # Will install any version starting with 3, and containing only
  # dots and numbers after
  - python: 3

  # Full specification of the parameter to identify the version;
  # this will install any version starting with 3.11.4, and
  # containing only dots and numbers after
  - python:
      version: 3.11.4

  # Use that version but only in the some/sub/dir directory
  - python:
      version: 3.11.4
      dir: some/sub/dir

  # This will install python 3.11.4 and run
  # pip install -r req.txt
  - python:
      version: 3.11.4
      pip: req.txt

  # This will install python 3.11.4 and run
  # pip install -r requirements.txt for each of dir1 and dir2
  - python:
      version: 3.11.4
      dir:
        - dir1
        - dir2
      pip: auto

  # Let omni lookup for version files in the project,
  # and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in each
  # of the directories identified with a version file
  - python:
      version: auto
      pip: auto
```

## Dynamic environment

The following variables will be set as part of the [dynamic environment](/reference/dynamic-environment).

| Environment variable | Operation | Description |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `PATH` | prepend | The `bin` directory for the loaded version of python |
| `PYTHONHOME` | unset | |
| `VIRTUAL_ENV` | set | The path to the python virtual environment |
