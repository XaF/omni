# `rust` operation

Installs rust to be used by the current repository.

:::note
Omni uses [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) in the background to manage that tool. The `asdf` installation of omni is in its own directory, and won't conflict with any installation of `asdf` you might have on your system.
:::

## Parameters

The following parameters can be used:

| Parameter        | Type      | Description                                           |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `dir` | path | Relative path (or list of relative paths) to the directory in the project for which to use the node version |
| `version` | string | The version of the tool to install; `latest` represents the last available stable version, `auto` will make omni lookup for any version files in the project directory (`.tool-versions` or `.rust-version`), any other string will be interpreted as a prefix, and the highest matching version with that prefix that otherwise contains only dots and numbers will be installed |

## Examples

```yaml
up:
  # Will install the latest version of rust
  - rust

  # And also
  - rust: latest

  # Let omni lookup for version files in the project
  - rust: auto

  # Will install any version starting with 1.70, and containing
  # only dots and numbers after
  - rust: 1.70

  # Will install any version starting with 1, and containing only
  # dots and numbers after
  - rust: 1

  # Full specification of the parameter to identify the version;
  # this will install any version starting with 1.70.0, and
  # containing only dots and numbers after
  - rust:
      version: 1.70.0

  # Use that version but only in the some/sub/dir directory
  - rust:
      version: 1.70.0
      dir: some/sub/dir
```
