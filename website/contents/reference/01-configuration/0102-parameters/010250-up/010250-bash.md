description: Configuration of the `bash` kind of `up` parameter

# `bash` operation

Installs bash to be used by the current repository.

:::note
Omni uses [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) in the background to manage that tool. The `asdf` installation of omni is in its own directory, and won't conflict with any installation of `asdf` you might have on your system.
:::

:::caution
Bash is installed using [a custom asdf plugin](https://github.com/XaF/asdf-bash). There is no guarantee all versions of bash will be able to build on all systems, especially older ones. We recommend using the `latest` version of bash if your intent is to ensure that users of your repository can use certain bash features.
