# `bash` operation

Installs bash to be used by the current repository.

:::note
Omni uses [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) in the background to manage that tool. The `asdf` installation of omni is in its own directory, and won't conflict with any installation of `asdf` you might have on your system.
:::

:::caution
Bash is installed using [a custom asdf plugin](https://github.com/XaF/asdf-bash). There is no guarantee all versions of bash will be able to build on all systems, especially older ones. We recommend using the `latest` version of bash if your intent is to ensure that users of your repository can use certain bash features.

## Parameters

The following parameters can be used:

| Parameter        | Type      | Description                                           |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `dir` | path | Relative path (or list of relative paths) to the directory in the project for which to use the node version |
| `version` | string | The version of the tool to install; `latest` represents the last available stable version, `auto` will make omni lookup for any version files in the project directory (`.tool-versions` or `.bash-version`), any other string will be interpreted as a prefix, and the highest matching version with that prefix that otherwise contains only dots and numbers will be installed |

## Examples

```yaml
up:
  # Will install the latest version of bash
  - bash

  # And also
  - bash: latest

  # Let omni lookup for version files in the project
  - bash: auto

  # Will install any version starting with 5.2, and containing
  # only dots and numbers after
  - bash: 5.2

  # Will install any version starting with 5, and containing only
  # dots and numbers after
  - bash: 5

  # Full specification of the parameter to identify the version;
  # this will install any version starting with 5.2.15, and
  # containing only dots and numbers after
  - bash:
      version: 5.2.15

  # Use that version but only in the some/sub/dir directory
  - bash:
      version: 5.2.15
      dir: some/sub/dir
```
