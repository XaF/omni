# `go` operation

Installs golang to be used by the current repository.

:::note
Omni uses [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) in the background to manage that tool. The `asdf` installation of omni is in its own directory, and won't conflict with any installation of `asdf` you might have on your system.
:::

## Alternative names

- `golang`

## Parameters

The following parameters can be used:

| Parameter        | Type      | Description                                           |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `dir` | path | Relative path (or list of relative paths) to the directory in the project for which to use the golang version |
| `version` | string | The version of the tool to install; `latest` represents the last available stable version, `auto` will make omni lookup for any version files in the project directory (`.tool-versions`, `.go-version`, `.golang-version` or `go.mod`), any other string will be interpreted as a prefix, and the highest matching version with that prefix that otherwise contains only dots and numbers will be installed |
| `version_file` | path | Relative path to the `go.mod` file where the golang version to install can be read from |

## Examples

```yaml
up:
  # Will install the latest version of golang
  - go

  # Will also install the latest version of golang
  - golang

  # Will also install the latest version
  - go: latest

  # Let omni lookup for version files in the project
  - go: auto

  # Will install any version starting with 1.20, and containing
  # only dots and numbers after
  - go: 1.20

  # Will install any version starting with 1, and containing only
  # dots and numbers after
  - go: 1

  # Full specification of the parameter to identify the version;
  # this will install any version starting with 1.20.5, and
  # containing only dots and numbers after
  - go:
      version: 1.20.5

  # Use that version but only in the some/sub/dir directory
  - go:
      version: 1.20.5
      dir: some/sub/dir

  # We can specify a version file; the file will be scraped
  # to search for the `go x.xx` version specification that omni
  # will be able to use
  - go:
      version_file: go.mod
```
