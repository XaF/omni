omni - omnipotent tool (v0.0.26-43-g4bdc6a1-dirty)

Change directory to the git directory of the specified repository

If no repository is specified, change to the git directory of the main org as specified by
OMNI_ORG, if specified, or errors out if not specified.

Usage: omni cd [OPTIONS] [repo]

Arguments:
  [repo]         The name of the repo to change directory to; this can be in the format
                 <org>/<repo>, or just <repo>, in which case the repo will be searched for in
                 all the organizations, trying to use OMNI_ORG if it is set, and then trying
                 all the other organizations alphabetically.

Options:
  --locate <LOCATE>        If provided, will only return the path to the repository instead of
                           switching directory to it. When this flag is passed, interactions
                           are also disabled, as it is assumed to be used for command line
                           purposes. This will exit with 0 if the repository is found, 1
                           otherwise.
  --[no-]include-packages <NO_INCLUDE_PACKAGES>
                           If provided, will include (or not include) packages when running
                           the command; this defaults to including packages when using
                           --locate, and not including packages otherwise.
