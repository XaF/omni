Change directory to the root of the specified work directory

If no work directory is specified, change to the git directory of the main org as specified
by OMNI_ORG, if specified, or errors out if not specified.

Usage: omni cd [OPTIONS] [WORKDIR]

Arguments:
  [WORKDIR]      The name of the work directory to change directory to; this can be in the
                 format <org>/<repo>, or just <repo>, in which case the work directory will be
                 searched for in all the organizations, trying to use OMNI_ORG if it is set,
                 and then trying all the other organizations alphabetically.

Options:
  -l, --locate            If provided, will only return the path to the work directory instead
                          of switching directory to it. When this flag is passed, interactions
                          are also disabled, as it is assumed to be used for command line
                          purposes. This will exit with 0 if the work directory is found, 1
                          otherwise.
  -p, --include-packages  If provided, will include packages when running the command; this
                          defaults to including packages when using --locate, and not
                          including packages otherwise.
  --no-include-packages   If provided, will NOT include packages when running the command;
                          this defaults to including packages when using --locate, and not
                          including packages otherwise.
