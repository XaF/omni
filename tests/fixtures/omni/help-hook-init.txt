Hook used to initialize the shell

The init hook will provide you with the command to run to initialize omni in your shell. You
can specify which shell you wish to load it for by specifying either one of zsh, bash, or
fish as optional parameter. If no argument is specified, the login shell, as provided by the
SHELL environment variable, will be used. You can load omni in your shell by using eval
"$(omni hook init YOURSHELL)" for bash or zsh, or omni hook init fish | source for fish.

The init hook supports the --alias <alias> option, which adds an alias to the omni command
with autocompletion support. It also supports the --command-alias <alias> <subcommand>
option, which adds an alias to the specified omni subcommand with autocompletion support.

Usage: omni hook init [OPTIONS] [shell]

Arguments:
  [shell]        Which shell to initialize omni for. Can be one of bash, zsh or fish.

Options:
  --alias <ALIAS>                  Create an alias for the omni command with autocompletion
                                   support.
  --command-alias <COMMAND_ALIAS> <COMMAND_ALIAS>
                                   Create an alias for the specified omni subcommand with
                                   autocompletion support. The second argument can be any omni
                                   subcommand, including custom subcommands.
  --shims                          Only load the shims without setting up the dynamic
                                   environment.
  --keep-shims-in-path             Prevent the dynamic environment from removing the shims
                                   directory from the PATH. This can be useful if you are used
                                   to launch your IDE from the terminal and do not have other
                                   means to load the shims in its environment.
  --print-shims-path               Print the path to the shims directory and exit. This should
                                   not be used to eval in a shell environment.
