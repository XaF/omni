Switch the source of a repository in the omnipath

This allows to change the omnipath source from using a package or a development version in a
worktree.

When switching into a mode, if the source of the requested type does not exist, the
repository will be cloned.

Usage: omni config path switch [OPTIONS] [REPOSITORY]

Arguments:
  [REPOSITORY]   The name of the repository to switch the source from; this can be in the
                 format <org>/<repo>, or just <repo>. If the repository is not provided, the
                 current repository will be used, or the command will fail if not in a
                 repository. If the repo is not found in the omnipath, the command will fail.

Options:
  -p, --package   Switch the source to use the package in the omnipath; this will clone the
                  repository if it does not exist. This defaults to toggling  between the two
                  sources if not specified.
  -w, --worktree  Switch the source to use the worktree in the omnipath; this will clone the
                  repository if it does not exist. This defaults to toggling  between the two
                  sources if not specified.
