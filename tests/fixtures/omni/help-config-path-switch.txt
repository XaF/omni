Switch the source of a repository in the omnipath

This allows to change the omnipath source from using a package or a development version in a
worktree.

When switching into a mode, if the source of the requested type does not exist, the
repository will be cloned.

Usage: omni config path switch [OPTIONS] [repo]

Arguments:
  [repo]         The name of the repository to switch the source from; this can be in the
                 format <org>/<repo>, or just <repo>. If the repository is not provided, the
                 current repository will be used, or the command will fail if not in a
                 repository. If the repo is not found in the omnipath, the command will fail.

Options:
  --<source> <SOURCE>  The source to use for the repository; this can be either --package or
                       --worktree, or will toggle between the two if not specified.

Source: builtin
