omni - omnipotent tool (v0.0.26-43-g4bdc6a1-dirty)

Sets up or tear down a repository depending on its up configuration

Usage: omni up [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --no-cache <NO_CACHE>                Whether we should disable the cache while running the
                                       command (default: no)
  --fail-on-upgrade <FAIL_ON_UPGRADE>  If provided, will fail the operation if a resource
                                       failed to upgrade, even if a currently-existing version
                                       can satisfy the dependencies (default: no)
  --bootstrap <BOOTSTRAP>              Same as using --update-user-config --clone-suggested;
                                       if any of the options are directly provided, they will
                                       take precedence over the default values of the options
  --clone-suggested <CLONE_SUGGESTED>  Whether we should clone suggested repositories found in
                                       the configuration of the repository if any (yes/ask/no)
                                       (default: no)
  --prompt <PROMPT>                    Trigger prompts for the given prompt ids, specified as
                                       arguments, as well as the currently unanswered prompts
  --prompt-all <PROMPT_ALL>            Trigger all prompts for the current work directory,
                                       even if they have already been answered
  --trust <TRUST>                      Define how to trust the repository (always/yes/no) to
                                       run the command
  --update-repository <UPDATE_REPOSITORY>
                                       Whether we should update the repository before running
                                       the command; if the repository is already up to date,
                                       the rest of the process will be skipped (default: no)
  --update-user-config <UPDATE_USER_CONFIG>
                                       Whether we should handle suggestions found in the
                                       configuration of the repository if any (yes/ask/no);
                                       When using up, the suggest_config configuration will be
                                       copied to the home directory of the user to be loaded
                                       on every omni call (default: no)
  --upgrade <UPGRADE>                  Whether we should upgrade the resources when the
                                       currently-installed version already matches version
                                       constraints. If false, this also means that if an
                                       already installed version for another repository
                                       matches version contraints, we will avoid downloading
                                       and building a more recent version (default: false)
