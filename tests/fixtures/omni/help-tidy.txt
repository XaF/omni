Organize your git repositories using the configured format

This will offer to organize your git repositories, moving them from their current path to
the path they should be at if they had been cloned using omni clone. This is useful if you
have a bunch of repositories that you have cloned manually, and you want to start using
omni, or if you changed your mind on the repo path format you wish to use.

Usage: omni tidy [OPTIONS] [up args]...

Arguments:
  [up args]...   Arguments to pass to omni up when running with --up-all

Options:
  --yes                        Do not ask for confirmation before organizing repositories
  --search-path <SEARCH_PATH>  Extra path to search git repositories to tidy up (repeat as
                               many times as you need)
  --up-all                     Run omni up in all the repositories with an omni configuration;
                               any argument passed to the tidy command after -- will be passed
                               to omni up (e.g. omni tidy --up-all -- --update-repository)
